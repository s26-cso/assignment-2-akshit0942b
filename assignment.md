Far far away, on the recently discovered exoplanet ISS-6701, at the Intergalactic  

Institute of Misinformation Technology, you are stranded after your spaceship  

broke down. Navigate the strange challenges on this planet in order to make it out  

alive.  

Question 1 [6 marks]  
You start working for the Computer Sisters Organization, a non-profit initiative by 7  

sisters to help the people of ISS-6701 using the power of computing. For one of their  

databases, they need to store a set of integers. They want to be able to retrieve and  

insert in 𝑂(log 𝑛) time. Using your knowledge from Earth, you point out that a binary  

search tree is best for this job.  

Your task is to implement the following functions corresponding to a binary search  

tree in an assembly file, namely q1.s. Follow the exact function signatures.  

struct Node* make_node(int val); // Returns a pointer to a struct with the  

given value and left and right pointers set to NULL.  

struct Node* insert(struct Node* root, int val); // insert a node with value  

val into the tree with the given root. Return the root.  

struct Node* get(struct Node* root, int val); // Return a pointer to a node  

with value val in the tree. Return NULL if no such node exists.  

int getAtMost(int val, struct Node* root); // Return the greatest value  

present in the tree which is <= val. Return -1 if no such node exists.  

The definition of struct Node is as follows:  

struct Node {  

    int val;  

    struct Node* left;  

    struct Node* right;  

};  

q1.s must only contain the definitions of the functions mentioned above. No more,  

no less (helper functions are allowed, just don’t expose them using .globl). We  

would recommend writing a main.c so that you can conveniently test your functions.  

Question 2 [6 marks]  
At the IgIMT, you sleep through your 8 AM alarm on the day of course registration  

and lowkenuinely get stuck with ISSian toe tickling 101. The reaching assistants of  

the course are very notorious. In particular, reaching assistant Crowtum likes to  

reach out to students and misinform them. He follows a specific pattern in doing so.  

Assume all the students are in a line, and their IQs are known. For any student that  

Crowtum misinforms (say student A), he looks for the first student after A in line with  

a strictly greater IQ than that student. For example, if Crowtum misinforms a student  

with IQ 100, then the next student he misinforms will have an IQ greater than 100,  

and will be the first person in line after A to do so. Given a misinformed student, can  

you find out which student will be misinformed next?  

Formal statement  
For each element in an array, find the position (0-indexed) of next greater element to  

its right. If there is no greater element to its right, return −1 for that position. Put your  

solution in a single assembly file, q2.s.  

Input format  
The elements of the array are space-separated integers (the students’ IQs) given as  

command line arguments.  

Output format  
The output should be a space-separated list of integers, where the ith integer is the  

position of the next greater element to the right of the ith element in the input array.  

Here, i is zero-indexed. If there is no greater element, the ith integer should be −1.  

Complexity  
Your solution must run in 𝑂(𝑛) time and 𝑂(𝑛) space, where 𝑛 is the number of  

elements in the array. For this, you can use a stack. You’re free to implement the  

stack however you want. You may take the help of this pseudocode:  

function next_greater(arr) {  

    let stack = new Stack()  

    let result = [-1] * len(arr)  

    for (let i = len(arr) - 1; i >= 0; i--) {  

        while (!stack.empty() && arr[stack.top()] <= arr[i]) stack.pop()  

        if (!stack.empty()) result[i] = stack.top()  

        stack.push(i)  

    }  

    return result  

}  

Examples  

./a.out 85 96 70 80 102  

1 4 3 4 -1  

./a.out 91 10 99 93 109 90 78  

2 2 4 4 -1 -1 -1  

Question 3 [6 marks + 8 bonus marks]  
You go to Room 411 in Trakul Nivas to have some fun with Raj but, in the words of his  

roommate, woh “bas aaya nahi”. You decide to wait for him but see that his laptop is  

open. You finally have the opportunity to find out why his “CSO notes” folder is 10  

terabytes huge. Unfortunately, the laptop is locked. What you do know is that the  

only thing keeping you from accessing the laptop is an executable which asks for the  

password.  

Part A [6 marks]  
You are given an executable named target_<your_github_username> in the q3/a/  

directory. This executable takes in input through stdin and check if it’s the correct  

password or not. If the password is correct, it prints out You have passed! If the  

password is incorrect, it prints Sorry, try again.  

Your task is to find out which input will make the executable print out the pass  

message. Since you have the binary, you may use whatever tools are available at  

your disposal to reverse engineer it.  

Passing criterion  

Your solution is correct if the process’s standard output is exactly  

You have passed! when the executable is run with the command  

./target_<your_github_username> < payload.txt.  

Part B (Bonus) [8 marks]  
Same scenario as before. You have a target executable present at  

q3/b/target_<your_github_username>, and the required input to make you pass must  

be present in the file called payload.  

The behaviour of the executable remains the same, but the implementation is a bit  

different. Can you find the required input?  

Passing criterion  

There’s a necessary relaxation in the passing criterion as compared to the previous  

part. Your solution is correct if the process’s standard output contains  

You have passed! when the executable is run with the command  

./target_<your_github_username> < payload.  

Hints  

• The executable was compiled with the -no-pie and -fno-PIE flags among  

other flags.  

• Perform an object dump to find out more about what the executable is  

doing.  

• Try giving a really large input to the executable. What happens?  

Question 4 [6 marks]  
You’ve been tasked with building a simple calc (short for calculator) app for the  

people on this planet. This app must take inputs through the command line in a loop.  

Each input line has the following format:  

<op> <num1> <num2>  

Where <op> is the name of a mathematical operation, and <num1> and <num2> are the  

two integer operands. All the arguments are space-separated. Example:  

add 12 9  

After receiving each line of input, your app must print out a single integer: the result  

of applying the specified operation to the two operands. Example:  

add 12 9  

21  

mul 3 4  

12  

Great! This app works, but only on Earth. The people of ISS-6701 don’t have the  

concept of addition and multiplication. Instead, they have their own set of  

operations. To make your life easier, they said they will provide shared libraries  

containing the implementation of these operations. Hence, your app must be able to  

support arbitrary operations.  

Shared library specifications  
For operation <op>, you will be provided with the definition of a function with name  

<op> and signature int, int -> int in a shared library named lib<op>.so in the  

current working directory. The string <op> is guaranteed to be at most 5 characters  

long. This function takes in the 2 integer operands and returns the result of the  

operation. However, these libraries are not provided at the time of compiling your  

code. Therefore, you will have to make sure you’re able to load their shared libraries  

while your app is running.  

Memory constraints  
Your app must not consume too much memory. At any point, your app’s memory  

usage must not exceed 2GB. It is given that each lib<op>.so is at most 1.5GB in size.  

Here’s an example run of the app on ISS-6701:  

grok 1 512  

8  

unc 32 -34  

98  

Programming language  
You must use C to implement this application. No third-party libraries are allowed.  

Put all your code in a single file, q4.c.  

Your task is to build your calc app in a way that fits these constraints. The people of  

ISS-6701 will be extensively testing your app to make sure what you print is in fact  

the output of their operation. Good luck!  

Question 5 [6 marks]  
ISSian toe tickling 101 has been a pain but your best friend Greyas helped you get  

through it, by cracking silent jokes with you throughout lectures. He also keeps  

sending you jokes on ThoughtsApp™.  

One day, he claims to have written the greatest joke of all time. It’s a palindrome too!  

You think this is too good to be true so you try to verify his claim. However, the joke  

is so long that it cannot be loaded into memory all at once. You need to find a way to  

check if the joke is a palindrome without loading the entire string into memory.  

Formal statement  
You are given a file named input.txt whose contents are a string which can be  

arbitrarily long. You need to read the contents of this file and check if the string is a  

palindrome. You can assume that the string consists only of lowercase alphabets.  

Output format  
Print Yes if the string is a palindrome, and No if it is not.  

Complexity  
Your solution must run in 𝑂(𝑛) time and 𝑂(1) space, where 𝑛 is the length of the  

string.  

Programming language  
Your entire solution must be in a single assembly file, q5.s.  

Example  

./a.out  

Yes  

In this case, the contents of input.txt could be something like abccba, which is a  

palindrome. If the contents were abc, then the output would be No.  

All the best!
